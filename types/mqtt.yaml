          If no user name is provided when an MQTT client connects, will default
          this user name in the authentication phase. If specified, this will
          override, for MQTT clients, any `no_auth_user` value defined in the
          main configuration file.
          *Note: that this is not compatible with running the server in
          operator mode.*

      ack_wait:

        aliases:

        description: |-
          This is the amount of time after which a QoS 1 message sent to
          a client is redelivered as a `DUPLICATE` if the server has not
          received the `PUBACK` packet on the original Packet Identifier.
          will cause the server to use the default value (30 seconds).

          Note that changes to this option is applied only to new MQTT
          subscriptions.

      max_ack_pending:
        type: integer
        default: 100
        aliases:
          - max_pending
          - max_inflight
        description: |-
          This is the amount of QoS 1 messages the server can send to
          a subscription without receiving any `PUBACK` for those messages.
          The valid range is [0..65535].

          The total of subscriptions' max_ack_pending on a given session cannot
          exceed 65535. Attempting to create a subscription that would bring
          the total above the limit would result in the server returning `0x80`
          in the `SUBACK` for this subscription.

          Due to how the NATS Server handles the MQTT `#` wildcard, each
          subscription ending with `#` will use 2 times the `max_ack_pending`
          value. Note that changes to this option is applied only to new
          subscriptions.

      js_domain:
        type: string
        description: |-
          If specified, sets an explicit JetStream domain to be used by MQTT.

      stream_replicas:
        type: integer
        description: |-
          If specified, sets an explicit number of stream replicas to be used
          for MQTT-backed streams.

          Set an explicit default inactive threshold for consumers used by MQTT.

    type: object
    properties:
      max_ack_pending:
        type: integer
        description: |-
          Defines the maximum number of in-flight messages allowed to be
          configured on consumers.

      max_ha_assets:
        type: integer
        description: |-
          The maximum number of JetStream assets that can exist at any given
          time having more than one replica.

      max_request_batch:
        type: integer
        description: |-
          The maximum request batch size allowed to be configured on pull
          consumers.

      duplicate_window:
        type: duration
        description: |-
          The maximum duplication window period allowed to be configured on
          a stream.

  jetstream:
    type: object
    reloadable: false
    description: |-
      If the JetStream block is defined, this implicitly enables
      JetStream, unless the `enabled` property is set to `false`.

    properties:
      enabled:
        type: boolean
        default: true
        aliases:
          - enable
        description: |-
          If true, enables the JetStream subsystem.

      store_dir:
        type: string
        aliases:
          - store
          - storedir
        default: /tmp/nats/jetstream
        description: |-
          Directory to use for file-based storage.

      max_memory_store:
        type: storage
        aliases:
          - max_mem_store
          - max_mem
        description: |-
          Maximum size of the *memory* storage.
          Defaults to 75% of available memory.

      max_file_store:
        type: storage
        aliases:
          - max_file
        description: |-
          Maximum size of the *file* storage.
          Defaults to up to 1TB if available.

      domain:
        type: string
        description: |-
          The JetStream domain the server is part of.

      encryption_key:
        type: string
        aliases:
          - key
          - ek
        description: |-
          If defined, enables JetStream filestore encryption using the
          value as the encryption key. A key length of at least 32 bytes
          is recommended. Note, this key is HMAC-256 hashed on startup which
          reduces the byte length to 64.

      cipher:
        type: string
        choices:
          - chacha
          - chachapoly
          - aes
        description: |-
          Defines the encryption algorithm to use if an encryption key is defined.

      extension_hint:
        type: string

      limits:
        type: jetstream-limits
        description: |-
          Default cross-account JetStream limits.

      unique_tag:
        type: string
        description: |-
          Defines a tag prefix as a constraint for placement of assets across
          a JetStream domain. For example, if the value is `az:` then replicas
          of an assets will be required to be placed on servers having
          different `az:` tags.

      max_outstanding_catchup:
        type: storage
        default: 32M
        description: |-
          Max in-flight bytes for stream catch-up. This was introduced to
          control how much bandwidth should be dedicated during catch-up to
          guard against saturating and degrading performance of the network.

      sync_interval:
        types:
          - duration
          - sync-interval-choices
        default: 2m
        aliases:
          - sync
        description: |-
          Defines the internal to force sync file-based stream and consumer data
          to disk. The filestore relies on the operating system's filesystem buffers
          to periodically sync to disk. However, the server will still periodically
          force sync files based on this interval.

          For use cases where unclean shutdowns are common, this can provide more
          control over how frequently to force sync data when written.

          If a value `always` is used, a explicit sync will occur on every write.
          Do note that this will degrade the max throughput due to the additional
          I/O calls.

  sync-interval-choices:
    type: string
    choices:
      - always

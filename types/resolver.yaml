        description: |-
          Defines whether the resolver type. A `full` resolver stores all
          account JWTs unless they are explicitly deleted.

          A `cache` resolver stores only a subset based on a least-recently-used
          (LRU) TTL.

      dir:
        type: string
        description: |-
          The path to storing account JWT files when pushed to the server.

      limit:
        type: integer
        description: |-
          If set, limit the number of stored JWTs. In `full` mode, new JWTs
          will be rejected where as in `cache` mode, old JWTs will be evicted
          for new JWTs.

      ttl:
        type: duration
        description: |-
          If `cache` mode, defines how long an account JWT will be cached
          for before being considered for auto-eviction.

      interval:
        type: duration
        description: |-
          Defines the interval the resolver will randomly contact another server
          to reconcile JWTs, such as receiving new ones and deleting old ones.

          Applies to `full` mode only.

      timeout:
        type: duration
        description: |-
          Defines the request timeout for resolvers interacting with with
          other resolvers.

      allow_delete:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |-
          If true, allows JWTs to be deleted. Note, in `full` mode, this will
          result in the JWT file being renamed to with a `.delete` suffix, unless
          `hard_delete` is true.

      hard_delete:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |-
          If true, and the resolver is in `full` mode, deleted account JWTs will
          be removed from disk rather than having the `.delete` suffix appended.
